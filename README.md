# csPaylocity
This is a c# implementation of my paylocity repo which was coded in java.

This also has some minor refactoring. The company object is completely implemented 
as compared to the java version that had it as a singleton.

My first c# program and I have to say the syntax does look at little cleaner than java
and a bit easier to read. Favorite C# feature so far is ExtensionMethods for types.
Syntactical sugar but tasty none the less.
